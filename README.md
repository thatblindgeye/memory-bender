# Memory-bender

## Description

"Long ago, the character cards lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the memory card game was created. Only you, master of memory, can defeat it."

Test how good your memory is with this memory card game, featuring characters from the animated television shows [Avatar: The Last Airbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender) and [The Legend of Korra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra).

### Features

- Built using React functional components and hooks.
- Theme toggle to play either with a dark theme (default) or a light theme.
- Keeps track of your personal high score for each session (resets when you visit the page again).

### How-To

The goal of the game is to remember which cards you have already clicked on, and to click on the cards that you have not yet clicked. Simple in concept, but is it as simple to win the game?
