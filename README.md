# Memory-bender

## Description

"Long ago, the character cards lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the memory card game was created. Only you, master of memory, can defeat it."

Test how good your memory is with this memory card game, featuring characters from the animated television shows [Avatar: The Last Airbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender) and [The Legend of Korra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra).

### Features

### How-To

The goal of the game is to remember which cards you have already clicked on, and to click on the cards that you have not yet clicked.

If your memory fails you, the game will start over and your score will be reset. If you are truly the master of memory, however, then you will be able to easily win this game, and perhaps restore some honor from any previous failed attempts at winning.
